1.<Hstack> is used to place childs horizontally.
2.<Image src={logo} /> here, source is not just a link,it should be imported. Example: import logo from '../assests/logo.webp'

3.This is called index signature. This represents a key or property in this object.

	const icons:{ [key:string]: Icontype }={
						web:BsGlobe,
						android:FaAndroid
						}

If we declare our object like this we will be able to call it like: 
								icons[web]  it will give us BsGlobe
								icons[platform.slug] it will give us BsGlobe if the value of 								platform.slug is 'web'
